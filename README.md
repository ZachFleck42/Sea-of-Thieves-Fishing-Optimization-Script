# Sea of Thieves Fishing Optimization Script

This is a simple script designed to determine the most efficient method of ignoring / catching / cooking fish of a species to maximize gold and reputation per hour.

It takes inputs of gold values for each variant of fish, the odds of encountering each variant of fish, and the times for catching/cooking each size of fish.

It outputs the results for each of the 3^10 (or 59,049) possible combinations or ignoring / catching / cooking fish into a .csv file.

Outputs for each combination are: Fish caught per hour, gold/reputation (value) earned per hour, time spent recasting per hour, and time spent cooking per hour.
